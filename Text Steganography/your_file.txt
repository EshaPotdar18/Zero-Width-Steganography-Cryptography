Steganography is like a secret code hidden in plain sight. Instead of encrypting a message, you hide it within something else, like an image, audio file, or even a text document. The hidden message is embedded in the data of the file in such a way that it's not easily noticeable to anyone who doesn't know where to look. It's a way of communicating covertly, without drawing attention to the fact that a message is being sent at all. Steganography has been used for centuries, from ancient times when messages were hidden in wax tablets to modern digital methods where information is concealed within the pixels of an image or the silence between audio samples. It's a powerful tool for spies, hackers, and anyone else who needs to keep their communications private.
